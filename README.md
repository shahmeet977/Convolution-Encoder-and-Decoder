# Convolution-Encoder-and-Decoder
This project is based on communication system, in which channel coding and decoding is done through Convolution Scheme. It is implemented in MATLAB and includes a convolution encoder whose output is passed through BEC,BSC and Gaussian Channel and the received sequence is decoded using decoding Algorithm known as Viterbi Algorithm.
